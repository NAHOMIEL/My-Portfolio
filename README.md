I have built a collection of responsive and interactive web projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
My portfolio includes landing pages, multi-section websites, and user interfaces that focus on clean design, functionality, 
and cross-device compatibility.
Each project reflects my ability to write clean code, 
implement smooth animations,
and create engaging user experiences with front-end technologies.
